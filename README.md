# Weather_U_Like_It_Or_Not

## Description

- I know the site is not functional.
- For some reason, the css won't import from the external link--this is part of the starter code and I'm not sure how to correct it so it is what it is right now.
- i have poured over this code for months and at this point, the grade can't hurt me. even if its only 20/100. I'll take it.
